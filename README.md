A powerful Python tool that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4o to automatically generate complete fullstack project structures. This tool acts as your AI development partner, creating organized directory structures, files with proper content, and a production-ready foundation for your projects.
Features

Generates entire project structures based on your description
Creates directories and files with proper content for various fullstack frameworks
Supports multiple project types (MERN, Django+React, etc.)
Ensures all operations are limited to the current working directory (safety first!)
No sudo commands allowed for enhanced security
Provides detailed summaries of generated projects
Tracks all created files and directories
Includes proper documentation and configuration files

How It Works
The tool communicates with OpenAI's GPT-4o API, allowing the AI to systematically build your project structure by making function calls to create directories, write files, and perform other necessary operations. The AI acts as an expert fullstack developer, creating a well-organized, production-ready project structure with professional code.
Perfect for quickly bootstrapping new projects or learning about proper project structures for different frameworks.
