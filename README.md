- **Complete Project Structure**: Creates directories, files, configuration, and documentation
- **Production-Ready Templates**: Generates code templates following industry best practices
- **Safety-First Approach**: All operations are restricted to the current working directory
- **Secure by Design**: No sudo commands allowed for enhanced security
- **Detailed Summaries**: Provides comprehensive reports of what was created
- **Environment Variable Support**: Securely manages API keys via .env files
- **Interactive Terminal Interface**: Simple and user-friendly input process
- **Multiline Description Support**: Enter detailed project requirements with formatting

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4o
- Recommended: Virtual environment for isolation

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/singhbipin2117/gen-ai-project-generator
cd gen-ai-project-generator
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
# For Linux/macOS
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a .env file in the project root:
```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here" > .env
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## üìù Usage

Simply run the generator and follow the interactive prompts:

```bash
python project_generator.py
```

You'll be prompted to provide:
1. The project type (e.g., "MERN Stack", "Django+React")
2. The project name
3. A detailed project description (supports multiple lines)

For the project description, type `END` on a new line when you've finished entering the description.

### Example Input Session
